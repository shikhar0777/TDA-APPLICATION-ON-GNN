# TDA-APPLICATION-ON-GNN

FOCUS ON MODELING
In recent years, topological data analysis (TDA) techniques, such as persistent homology and the mapper algorithm, have been applied to small-scale graph neural networks (GNNs). This research will investigate the feasibility of applying TDA to GNNs for the purpose of detecting cyber threats. Furthermore, the research will explore various mathematical and computational techniques to reduce algorithmic complexity.
